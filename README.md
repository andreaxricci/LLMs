 LLMs - Prompt Engineering Techniques

This notebooks follows the structure provided by the course "ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers", offered by Deeplearning.ai & OpenAI. Source: https://learn.deeplearning.ai/chatgpt-prompt-eng/

It's a very well done course - I encourage you to take it!

Adaptations:

 - I've used the Langchain framework

 - I've replaced (most of) the examples used in the course, with examples from the medical domain
